Issues:
High

Med
- blade flash on retract (neopixel???)
- can reduce sub-buffer size? effect on perf? encapselation?
- drop vbat sample time, increase samples. move timing const into AveragePower class

Low
- Fix analogReference()

Fixed
x neopixels create noise: not fixed, but confirmed. neopixels throw off timers? But create noise. Dotstar does not.
x access to general pins
x power accelerometer
x clean up amp pins
x re-do ratline
x space out vias on board better
x trigger interupt from DMA? Remove timer?
x correctly connect amp select pin. Luck on my side, should be correctly setting left channel.
x enable shutdown pin on amp? 2-3mA draw. Basically an LED.
x dotstar support in itsy
x sound stutter
x experiment w/ different timing & buffers
x SPI is "over mutexed". there are 2 SPIs
x Better audio compression
x compact resistors
x extra capacitor for neopixels
x configure defaults correctly
x Support neopixel output
x fix / test accelerometer
x test on battery
x Fix voltmeter
x Sound based UI ("palette", "audio", "ready", 0-7)
x Connect RF24
x switch to new version
x PWM for LED
x select pin move/test (CSN is select)
x enable pin move/test (why are the names so bad???)
x initial role pin?
x start system with audio shutdown
x doesn't start with correct font
x test full circuit
x check alt grnd, vcc, etc. on battery circuit
x switch to battery version
x test audio output with scope
x test LED output with scope
x multiple sound banks
x font name
x fix sound light
x bootup sound
x shutdown audio
x ignite / retract times
x tune motion and impact
x read startup time from sound card
x red led for low power: flash power button?
x reset command
x optimize string uses, mem usage, etc.
x account for Vcc
x de-ring resistors
x rework MMA code
x figure out names: palette & font
x pull down resistors for gates. woh.
x sound on/off
x integrate sound calls into state code
x split out blade rendering code
x switch blade color banks
x correct ignite / retract times. From sound files?
x sound
x sound priorities
x motion sensing
x EEPROM writer sketch
x way to reset EEPROM
