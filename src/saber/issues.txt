Issues:

Current
- implement general analogWrite (grumble)
- fix LED manager to be not weird, and not call arduino library funcs
- correct colors for darksaber
- sync wav12 to i2saudio2, test
- sync i2saudio2 to saber, test
- load new colors & sounds
- DARKSABER!
- Smooth out gyro sound?
x Retract is WAY too slow

High
- fix vol>255 not working
- volume boost support for fonts
- blade flash on retract. completely mystified

Med

Icebox


Notes
50  708080 (cool white)
40  596666
30  434C4C -> 414cc4
20  2D3333 -> 253333
10  161919 -> 101919

30 -> 65/67 -> 0.97
20 -> 37/45 -> 0.82
10 -> 16/22 -> 0.73


Fixed
x Turn off UI LED idle animation when there is a crystal
x Remove axis rotation from gyro
x switch to gyro.
x a little less motion sensitivity
x dropout during green spin
x fix floating point average to not drift
x clean up code
x tune swing intensity
x test button up on color wheel
x white is causing trouble
x set max swing (so it isn't over accumulating)
x sensitivity up and down
x test out filtering mag but not speed vectors - may not need decay code
x less motion sensitivity
x clipping / limiting in mixer (maybe 64 bit okay??)
x Crackle in hum sound (how??)
x correct sound font for leia
x smooth swing decay, decay class
x ignite / retract mode state
x playing hum past retract
x need to keep updating / reset magnemometer
x powerLevel or vbatToPowerLevel...both is crazy
x volume smoothing (driver)
x volume "drag" (SFX)
x Color section mode
x Tester: turn back on blade flash using delays
x Tester: Blade doesn't change color
x Fix analogReference(), deprecated by i2s audio
x blade flash on retract. Neopixel not the issue. Add assert?
    x range checks in fixed
    x start / end checks on interp
x high res mode for crystal / color.
  x fixed point computation
  x PWM for dotstar
x can reduce sub-buffer size? effect on perf? encapselation?
x drop vbat sample time, increase samples. move timing const into AveragePower class
x neopixels create noise: not fixed, but confirmed. neopixels throw off timers? But create noise. Dotstar does not.
x access to general pins
x power accelerometer
x clean up amp pins
x re-do ratline
x space out vias on board better
x trigger interupt from DMA? Remove timer?
x correctly connect amp select pin. Luck on my side, should be correctly setting left channel.
x enable shutdown pin on amp? 2-3mA draw. Basically an LED.
x dotstar support in itsy
x sound stutter
x experiment w/ different timing & buffers
x SPI is "over mutexed". there are 2 SPIs
x Better audio compression
x compact resistors
x extra capacitor for neopixels
x configure defaults correctly
x Support neopixel output
x fix / test accelerometer
x test on battery
x Fix voltmeter
x Sound based UI ("palette", "audio", "ready", 0-7)
x Connect RF24
x switch to new version
x PWM for LED
x select pin move/test (CSN is select)
x enable pin move/test (why are the names so bad???)
x initial role pin?
x start system with audio shutdown
x doesn't start with correct font
x test full circuit
x check alt grnd, vcc, etc. on battery circuit
x switch to battery version
x test audio output with scope
x test LED output with scope
x multiple sound banks
x font name
x fix sound light
x bootup sound
x shutdown audio
x ignite / retract times
x tune motion and impact
x read startup time from sound card
x red led for low power: flash power button?
x reset command
x optimize string uses, mem usage, etc.
x account for Vcc
x de-ring resistors
x rework MMA code
x figure out names: palette & font
x pull down resistors for gates. woh.
x sound on/off
x integrate sound calls into state code
x split out blade rendering code
x switch blade color banks
x correct ignite / retract times. From sound files?
x sound
x sound priorities
x motion sensing
x EEPROM writer sketch
x way to reset EEPROM
