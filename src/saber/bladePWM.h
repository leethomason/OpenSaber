    SaberDB: the database that holds the blade colors.
        Data. Just holds colors.

    BladeFlash: Animation code for an on blade.
        Assumes the blade is on; doesn't track the state.

    BladeState: state, whether the blade is on, off, ignite, retract.
        The 'process' method combines the state, color from BladeFlash,
        and writes the current color to the Blade.

    The BladePWM has no state (except it's target color and voltage.) It takes 
        an input color and translates it to an output electrical signal.
        The call to the color or voltage can be at any time, and it will update.
